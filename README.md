these python scripts control the data base

1) python create_db.py  -- this script creates a database, or summarizes existing db
   	  		-- to delete a db use futon, don't want to automate it

2) python add_entry.ph  -- just run this guy and fill in the blanks. BAM! a new document appears
   	  		-- it pulls the structure from schema.py
			-- to fix data entry errors use futon. double click on the field and save the change

3) schema.py            -- literally a one liner, it is just a lists of fields for the document

4) cd_projections.py	-- plots the projected date for CD2 versus the date the projection was made
